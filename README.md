This is part of my non academic project, where I have created a python tool to inspect incomming and outgoing packets.
Using allowed and not_allowed text files to configure the tool.
As the name suggests, it will allow the ip and port in the allowed list and block ip and port in the not_allowed list.
Th tool uses flask web interface to monitor the traffic and droped packets in a graphical way.
